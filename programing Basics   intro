Dart is an open-source programming language originally developed by Google.
It is meant for both the server side as well as the user side.
The Dart SDK comes with its compiler – the Dart VM and a utility dart2js 
which is meant for generating the Javascript equivalent of a Dart Script so that it can be run on those sites also which don’t support Dart.
